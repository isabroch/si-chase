## What happened?  
On asking why Saa has come to White Moon Cove.    
>  My brother was killed.    
>  My mother abandoned me.    
>  My second mother left me for another woman.    
>  I don't like my previous place anymore.    

An adventurer, who has met Saa before, asks about 'Indr'. Her mother, perhaps?  
>   _An illusion appears of a cloud in which a room is seen, Indr is leaving while singing a lullaby._  
>   _Indr sings a soft lullabye as she wraps Saa in the blanket._  
>   "Goodnight my angel, now it's time to dream   
>   And dream how wonderful your life will be   
>   Someday your child may cry, and if you sing this lullaby   
>   Then in your heart there will always be a part of me   
>   Someday we'll all be gone   
>   But lullabies go on and on   
>   They never die   
>   That's how you and I will be"   
>   _Then heads out of the guidhall with her things, making her way to the portal_  

Saa writes of a duty she has.  
>  Saa has duty  
>  Power fragmented that needs coalescing  

It is assumed to be about the Shards.   
She seems able to ascertain the strength of adventurers, likening them to a fire.  
Embers seem to be weaker adventurers, while 'a fire burns ablaze' must mean the stronger adventurers.  

When a weaker adventurer offered to help, this was the response.  
>  Ember should only try these,  
>  The larger ones only when your fire burns ablaze.  
>  Be careful  
>
>  Splintered through great conflict and the passing of time fragments seeped into the world  
>
>  Stripped of many eyes, battleworn, guiding those hungry for power, duplicity  
>  A trinket, collected on private display  
>  Violently, the earth was sundered, from within 6 legged abomination emerged from the horrors that lie beneath the dirt  
>  A green dome of glass, within your blood will boil if you stay too long  
>  By boat he plundered, by the bay he drank, his ship ravaged by the shore  

There is some possible urgency, as when asked about a deadline:  
>  Before I am hunted, before they are claimed  

She only has this to say about what should happen with the shards:  
>  Bring Shards to me or do not  
>  Bring Shards to another or do not  
>  Change them or do not  
>
>  It is your own path  
>
>  No path is evil, no path is good  
>  No paths are chaotic, no paths are lawful  
>  There is only the self  
>  The generations before  
>  The generations after you  

When retiring for the evening, Saa declined to stay in the tavern. She said to call out her name when needing to talk with her, and she will arrive (ping @DGM and say "Saa! Let's talk!" or something like that).  
She then turned invisible.
